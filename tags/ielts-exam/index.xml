          &lt;p&gt;I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use react to integrate REST API. So I became a part of front-end developer as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am highly organized. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method to always find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and also helps the rest of the team stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a leader quality. I find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I’m not in a leadership role because if I don’t know the answer, I’ll at least point them in the right direction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with new clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am results-oriented, constantly checking in to determine how close or how far away we are and what it will take to make it happen. I find this pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an excellent communicator. I pride myself on making sure people have the right information because it drives better results. Most business issues stem from poor communication, so I feel a responsibility to keep everyone on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
